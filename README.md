This project involves using Python to implement a variation of the classic water jug puzzle. I created a WaterJugPuzzle class that defines the state space, legal moves, and rules for solving the puzzle. The goal is to reach a specified target amount of water by applying a sequence of legal operations on two jugs of different capacities.

In this assignment, I implemented safeguards against illegal states and documented each rule with clear comments to ensure readability and reproducibility. The solution demonstrates step-by-step rule application from the initial state to the goal state. The project highlights the use of AI problem-solving techniques such as state representation and rule-based reasoning.
