### Water Jug Puzzle
https://github.com/EmilyForeacre/Portfolio/blob/main/AI/AI_HW1%20(8).ipynb

This project involves using Python to implement a variation of the classic water jug puzzle. I created a WaterJugPuzzle class that defines the state space, legal moves, and rules for solving the puzzle. The goal is to reach a specified target amount of water by applying a sequence of legal operations on two jugs of different capacities.

In this assignment, I implemented safeguards against illegal states and documented each rule with clear comments to ensure readability and reproducibility. The solution demonstrates step-by-step rule application from the initial state to the goal state. The project highlights the use of AI problem-solving techniques such as state representation and rule-based reasoning.

### Robot Nurse Pathfinding with A and Dijkstra's Algorithms*
https://github.com/EmilyForeacre/ai-final-project-team7

This project involves using Python to simulate a robot nurse delivering medication and collecting test samples in a hospital environment. I implemented both A* and Dijkstra's algorithms to navigate a grid-based map of the hospital, finding the optimal paths while avoiding obstacles.

The robot starts at a specified location and processes delivery requests based on a priority queue of hospital wards. The program ensures that higher-priority deliveries are handled efficiently and that the robot always follows the shortest feasible path to its next goal. The simulation outputs the traced paths for successful deliveries and provides warnings when certain requests cannot be completed due to obstacles.

This project demonstrates the use of AI search algorithms in real-world robotics applications, emphasizing pathfinding, priority handling, and obstacle management.

### Restaurant Inventory
https://github.com/EmilyForeacre/Portfolio/tree/main/Restaurant%20Inventory

This project involves using Java to implement a restaurant inventory program. I created a Product class that defines each product’s attributes, including name, SKU, price, and quantity, along with a static variable to track the total number of products. The program demonstrates the use of constructors, a deep copy constructor, getters and setters, and static methods.

In this assignment, I implemented input validation to ensure unique SKUs, displayed all product information using a toString method, and updated product quantities using setter methods. The solution highlights object-oriented programming concepts such as static variables, static methods, and copying objects, while maintaining clear and well-documented code for readability and reproducibility.

### R Package Presentation
https://github.com/EmilyForeacre/Portfolio/tree/main/R%20Package%20Presentation

This project involves researching and presenting an R package that was not covered in class. I explored the package’s purpose, demonstrated its key functions, and applied it to a real dataset to illustrate practical use cases. The project includes a slide presentation explaining the package’s features and an R script with working examples.

The assignment highlights my ability to explore new R tools, communicate new concepts effectively, and provide hands-on examples of the concepts.

### Data Mining
https://github.com/EmilyForeacre/Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Mining

This project involves re-analyzing a dataset from a prerequisite course using R. I built a final model and generated additional insights or visualizations, translating previous analyses done in Python into R. The project demonstrates reproducible data analysis, model-building, and effective use of R for statistical modeling and visualization.

### Matlab Calc III Project
https://github.com/EmilyForeacre/Portfolio/tree/main/Matlab%20Project

This project involves using MATLAB to solve a series of calculus problems based on concepts from Calculus III, including integrals and bounds determined from a personal dataset. I implemented MATLAB commands to compute integrals, generate figures, and document all intermediate steps and calculations.

# Database Management
### Doctor's Portal Web application
https://github.com/EmilyForeacre/DBMS_Final_Project

This project involves creating a 3-tier client/server web application using a web browser, Node.js server, and MySQL database. I implemented a doctors portal where the server handles requests from the browser, interacts with the database to execute queries, and returns results in HTML format. The project highlights practical skills in Node.js, MySQL, and building interactive web applications for real-world scenarios.
